-- Step 2: Optimize the Prep CTE by reducing the use of UNNEST

    GROUP BY 
        event_date,

)

-- Step 4: Utilize the GA CTE without modifications (already optimized)
, ga AS (

)

-- Step 5: Optimize the Email Campaign CTE by reducing unnecessary columns and filters
, email_campaign AS (

          PARTITION BY _campaignid, _code

)

-- Step 6: Optimize the Get Campaign ID CTE by reducing UNNEST usage
, get_campaignid AS (

, campaign_ids AS (

)

-- Step 8: Optimize the Google Analytic Activity CTE
, google_analytic_activity AS (

    SELECT 
        activity.*,
        SPLIT(SUBSTR(traffic_source.name, STRPOS(traffic_source.name, '?j=') + 3), '&')[ORDINAL(1)] AS _campaignids,

    FROM `x-marketing.analytics_411351491.events_*` activity
    LEFT JOIN 
        UNNEST(user_properties) AS user -- Unnest user properties to access `user.value.string_value`
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'ga_session_id')
)

-- Step 9: Optimize the All Data CTE by using the previously optimized CTEs
, all_data AS (

  SELECT 
    activity.*,
    l.*,
    c.campaign_id
  FROM google_analytic_activity activity
  LEFT JOIN contact l ON activity.user_value = l.id -- Use `activity.user_value` to join with `contact`
  LEFT JOIN ga ON activity.user_value = ga.ids AND ga.event_date = activity.event_date
  LEFT JOIN campaign_ids c ON activity.session_id = c.ga_id
)

-- Final Select with Optimized Joins and Filters
SELECT 
  datas.*,
  email_campaign.*
FROM all_data AS datas
LEFT JOIN email_campaign ON datas.campaign_id = email_campaign.airtable_id;
